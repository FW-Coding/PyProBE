Initial Charge:
  Type: "SOC Reset"
  Steps: 
    - "Rest for 4 hours"
    - "Charge at constant current of 4mA and constant voltage of 4.2V until current drops to 0.04A"
    - "Rest for 2 hours"
Break-in Cycles:
  Type: "Cycling"
  Steps: 
    - "Discharge at constant current of 4mA until voltage reaches 3V"
    - "Rest for 2 hours"
    - "Charge at constant current of 4mA and constant voltage of 4.2V until current drops to 0.04A"
    - "Rest for 2 hours"
    - Repeat: 5
Discharge Pulses:
  Type: "Pulsing"
  Steps: 
    - "Rest for 10 seconds"
    - "Discharge at constant current of 20mA until 4mAh has passed or voltage reaches 3V"
    - "Rest for 30 minutes"
    - "Rest for 1.5 hours"
    - Repeat: 10
