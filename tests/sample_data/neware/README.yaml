Initial Charge: # Experiment title
  Steps: # Steps list, descriptions are PyBaMM experiment strings
    1: Rest for 4 hours # Start with index 1
    # CC-CV charge provided as two seperate PyBaMM experiment strings
    2: Charge at 4mA until 4.2 V, Hold at 4.2 V until 0.04 A 
    3: Rest for 2 hours
Break-in Cycles:
  Steps: 
    4: Discharge at 4 mA until 3 V
    5: Rest for 2 hours
    6: Charge at 4 mA until 4.2 V, Hold at 4.2 V until 0.04 A
    7: Rest for 2 hours
  Cycle: # Cycle instruction, contains start, end and count
    Start: 4 # loop starts with step 4 (inclusive)
    End: 7 # loop ends with step 7 (inclusive)
    Count: 5
Discharge Pulses:
  Steps: 
    # Neware considers cycling (in previous experiment) to be its own step,
    # so Step 8 is skipped
    9: Rest for 10 seconds
    10: Discharge at 20 mA for 0.2 hours or until 3 V
    11: Rest for 30 minutes
    12: Rest for 1.5 hours
  Cycle:
    Start: 9
    End: 12
    Count: 10
