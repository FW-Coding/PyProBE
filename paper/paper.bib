	abstract = {Degradation in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery cells is the result of a complex interplay of a host of different physical and chemical mechanisms. The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the first time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is refined and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identification and quantification of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by fitting the cells' OCV.},

	abstract = {Incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) analyses are effective for monitoring battery health, however, the diagnosis often requires considerable parameterisation efforts and a low scan rate. In this work, a simple-to-parameterise quantitative diagnostic approach is presented, which differentiates between loss of lithium inventory and loss of active materials in the anode and cathode. With an open-circuit voltage model and a genetic algorithm optimisation routine, peak signatures in voltage and capacity differentials are used to quantify degradation modes as opposed to traditional approaches of matching the whole voltage and capacity spectra. The outputs are validated with synthetic IC-DV spectra and achieve a low root-mean-square error of ± 2.0 \%. A similar level of accuracy is achieved when heterogeneity is introduced in the synthetic degradation data and also with partial discharge data. Experiments from pouch cells under 5 C discharge and 0.3 C charge cycling at 25 °C and 45 °C, together with post-mortem measurements, confirm the accuracy of this approach with diagnosis scan taken at 0.3 C. The IC-DV peak-tracking quantitative diagnostic code demonstrates a reliable and easy-to-implement means of extracting deeper insights into battery degradation and is shared alongside this manuscript to help academia and industry develop better lifetime predictions.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries in automotive applications, understanding their use and degradation is becoming more and more important. This paper presents a new method to quantify cell degradation’s multidimensional aging and inhomogeneity. The proposed algorithm is inspired by data-driven modal reduction. Offline findings from measured differential voltage curves and electrochemical simulations are encrypted in low-rank patterns, suitable for on-board application. A dataset of eighteen automotive pouch cells with graphite anode and NMC-622 cathode that were cycled for accelerated aging is used to generate orthogonal aging modes. The cycling is performed with two different load profiles, yielding homogeneous and inhomogeneous cell aging. The cell capacity is estimated for eight test cells with a polynomial function, making a Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) of 0.3\% over their entire lifetime. The loss of active lithium and loss of active material at the anode and the cathode are fitted in polynomials depending on references from physical–chemical simulations. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of cell aging is estimated, recognizing a pattern of modal coordinate evolution that links the reference differential voltage curves to post-mortem findings from the literature.},

Consequently, to enable safe and reliable use of LIB systems, diagnosis and prognosis have become critical. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning algorithms have achieved significant impacts for image or object recognition, yet their application for battery diagnosis is still at an early developing stage. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for battery degradation diagnosis based on the representation of battery data as images, in order to leverage the use of well-established Convolutional Neural Networks. Accuracy for diagnosis, via the quantification of degradation modes was tested on synthetic data. Our approach was shown to be more accurate than current methodologies with Root Mean Squared Errors around 2\% on average for 1000 duty cycles compared to between 2.64 to 7.27\% for other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that the proposed methodology adapts to various cell chemistries and constructive configurations, and validate its applicability to a real-world scenario with experimental data from commercial LIBs.},
